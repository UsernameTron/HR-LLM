  Benefits    |   0.95    |  0.93   |   0.94
  Tech Stack  |   0.92    |  0.88   |   0.90
  Culture     |   0.90    |  0.87   |   0.88
  ```

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Processing Speed:**
  - Average Job Post Analysis: ~100ms
  - Batch Processing: 1000 posts/second
  - Model Loading (Cold Start): < 3s
  - Model Loading (Cached): < 500ms

- **Resource Usage:**
  ```
  Operation          | CPU Usage | Memory   | Time
